# JSBML-1.5


We are pleased to announce the release of JSBML-1.5, which is now available for download from GitHub (above).

JSBML is a community-driven project to create a free, open-source, pure Java library for reading, writing, and manipulating
[SBML](http://sbml.org) files and data streams. It is an alternative to the mixed Java/native code-based interface provided 
in [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML).

For more details, please visit the JSBML project home page:

This is mainly a bug fix release for SBML core. Many fixes and improvement have been made to the SBML level 3 packages implementations. We support the new SBML Level 3 distrib package version 1, we support the latest draft specification for the spatial package, the render and spatial packages validation was implemented.

**New features**
* We support the new SBML Level 3 `distrib` version 1 package
* We support the latest draft specification for the `spatial` package
* The validation for the packages `render` and `spatial` was implemented.

You can find a detailed list of the user-visible new features and bug fixes since JSBML version 1.4 on the [NEWS](NEWS.md) file.

Thank you for your interest and support of JSBML and SBML in general.
